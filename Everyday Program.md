#Write down what I learned everyday

##2015.03.22
* Learned how to read from a file in Python
* How to create a text file
* How to in/output
* Even practiced a little bit with Git (amazing tool, though can be hard to use)
* And here I'm using Markdown!(found myself quite love reading out its name...)
